      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Beat the eggs</b>: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed. 
          You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.
        </li>
        
        <li><b>Heat the pan</b>: Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.</li>
        
        <li>
          <b>Cook the omelette</b>: Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure 
          the eggs evenly coat the surface.
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <b>Add fillings (optional)</b>: When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the 
          middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <b>Fold and serve</b>: As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the 
          fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <b>Enjoy</b>: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.
        </li>
      </ol>
