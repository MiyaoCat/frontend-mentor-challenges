# frontend-mentor-challenges
I started doing the challenges from [Frontend Mentor]([url](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home)) as a way to keep up with my Frontend Dev skills and a reason for me to continously commit code (those green squares are addicting). I began doing them in February 2024 and I try to do a couple a week. I appreciate the feedback I get from the seasoned Frontend Devs. I've also gotten rusty with my Javascript so these challenges have helped me sharpen those skills. Another thing I appreciate about the challenges is that I don't have to think about any of the design work. I enjoy turning design files into webpages and that's all this is. It's perfect for me in terms of the work I enjoy doing. I try to make it pixel perfect, but since I don't have the pro version it can be a little difficult getting the margins and spacing right.
